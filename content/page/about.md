Hello, I'm Marvin!

I am a developer who currently lives and works in the beautiful city of [Toronto][2]!

I used to work as a developer at [FreshBooks][7] (a SaaS accounting company)
where I got to play with all parts of the stack -- it was very interesting
work!

My [GitHub][3] page is a pretty good place to get a feel for what I am working
on these days. I open-source a lot of the projects I am working on because I
believe in giving back where I can.

Having said that, here are some places you can find me:

- [GitHub][3]
- [Twitter][4]
- IRC (`marvinpinto` on [Freenode][5])



### Hire Me &#9732;

I am currently looking for either a Backend Developer or a Full Stack role so
if this sounds like a good fit, I would love to hear from you!



### Email &#9832;

If email is your thing, my address is `hello@pinto.im`. Be warned though, I am
terrible with email &#9785;



### Errata &#9997;

If you do notice any errors or omissions on this site, let me know. The source
code is up on [GitHub][6] -- Issues or Pull Requests are always welcome!
&#10055;



### Lady &#9752;

This right here is my derpy dog Lady. She is very adorable and I thought you
should know.
