Hi, I'm Marvin!

I currently work as a developer at [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com), a
small SaaS company based out of Toronto. I work on the build-tools team which
means I get to play with all parts of the stack. It's very interesting!

I tend to open-source a lot of my side/pet projects so do feel free to look
around on my [GitHub](https://github.com/marvinpinto) profile.

I also tend to [tweet](https://twitter.com/marvinpinto) fairly often and hang
out on IRC a bit too much (`marvinpinto` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net)).
Always up to chat anytime!

### Contact

If email is your thing, please do feel free to email me at `hello@pinto.im` but
be warned that I am terrible with email but I do try my best :(
