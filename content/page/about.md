<i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o"> Hello, I'm Marvin!</i>

{{< img src="marvin-pinto-profile.jpg" alt="Marvin Pinto" height="135" width="135" class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-right">}}

I'm a software developer who lives and works in the beautiful [City of
Toronto][2]. I started my own company a little while back as part of shipping a
side project I've been working on - [Switchboard][switchboard] (more info
below). If you're looking for a consultant or to fill a full-time
development role, get in touch! I'm always up to chat.

### <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i> Errata

The source code and content for this website both live in the <a
href="https://github.com/marvinpinto/disjoint.ca"><i class="fa fa-github">
marvinpinto/disjoint.ca</i></a> repository on GitHub. If you spot any mistakes
or catch me in an outright lie I'd love to [hear from you][4] <i class="fa
fa-thumbs-o-up"></i>



### <i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> Credits

- **TIL Section**: This idea was very much inspired by [des4maisons][11] and
[jbranchaud][12]'s TIL repositories on GitHub. My hope is that indexers pick
this up and it becomes helpful to other people as well.

- **Front page banner**: The original image for this lovely banner was borrowed
from the gallery at [unsplash.com][14], which [des4maisons][13] then took over
and made even more awesome!

- **Logo**: The logo for the disjoint.ca website was borrowed and adapted from
the wonderful folks at [Fairpixels][16] (via [logodust.com][15]). Look them up
for your logo needs!

- **Hugo Static Site Generator**: Can't forget to mention that this site itself
was developed using [Hugo][3] - A Fast & Modern Static Website Engine.



### <i class="fa fa-paw"></i> Lady

{{< img src="derpy-lady.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-left" alt="Derpy Lady the Dog">}}

And last but not least this here is my derpy dog Lady! She is very awkward for
her age and completely adorable. We rescued her as a puppy from a shelter in
Ontario called [Blue Collared Canines][6] and she's been a delightful addition
to our family ever since.

If you follow me on Twitter I promise to stop tweeting about techy stuff and
stick to [doggy pictures only][1] <i class="fa fa-hand-spock-o"></i>
