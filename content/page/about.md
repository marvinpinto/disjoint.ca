<i class="fa fa-hand-peace-o"> Hello, I'm Marvin!</i>

<img src="/images/marvin-pinto-profile.jpg" alt="Marvin Pinto" height="135" width="135" class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-right">

I'm a developer who lives and works in the beautiful [City of Toronto][2]! I
previously worked at a SaaS accounting company called [FreshBooks][7] where I
got to build cool systems and play with all parts of the stack -- it was very
interesting work!

Here's where you can find me on the Internet:

### <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Recent Projects

- **Open Sentinel** is a distributed monitoring system I'm working on with a
few other people. Its REST backend will be powered by AWS API Gateway and
Lambda, fronted by an EmberJS single-page-app. This project is very much in its
infancy. The really neat thing here is that we intend on open-sourcing all the
components right from the beginning so you get to experience everything, warts
and all! Follow along on the <a href="https://github.com/opensentinel"><i
class="fa fa-github"> opensentinel</i></a> org on GitHub.

- **Charlesbot** is a modular Slackbot written using Python 3's asyncio
framework. It was designed to be self-deployed and easily extendible (via the
plugin system). More information to come! For now, read up some more on
[charlesbot.org][8] and follow along its development at <a
href="https://github.com/marvinpinto/charlesbot"><i class="fa fa-github">
marvinpinto/charlesbot</i></a>.

- **IRC Hooky** makes it easy to send custom webhook-triggered notifications to
IRC using an entirely serverless architecture. Read more about it at
[irchooky.org][9] and the article I wrote titled [Using a Serverless
Architecture to deliver IRC Webhook Notifications][10].



### <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o"></i> Errata

The source code and content for this website both live in the <a
href="https://github.com/marvinpinto/disjoint.ca"><i class="fa fa-github">
marvinpinto/disjoint.ca</i></a> repository on GitHub. If you spot any mistakes
or catch me in an outright lie I'd love to [hear from you][4] <i class="fa
fa-thumbs-o-up"></i>



### <i class="fa fa-bullhorn"></i> Credits

- **TIL Section**: This idea was very much inspired by [des4maisons][11] and
[jbranchaud][12]'s TIL repositories on GitHub. My hope is that indexers pick
this up and it becomes helpful to other people as well.

- **Front page banner**: The original image for this lovely banner was borrowed
from the gallery at [unsplash.com][14], which [des4maisons][13] then took over
and made even more awesome!

- **Logo**: The logo for the disjoint.ca website was borrowed and adapted from
the wonderful folks at [Fairpixels][16] (via [logodust.com][15]). Look them up
for your logo needs!

- **Hugo Static Site Generator**: Can't forget to mention that this site itself
was developed using [Hugo][3] - A Fast & Modern Static Website Engine.



### <i class="fa fa-paw"></i> Lady

<img src="/images/derpy-lady.jpg" alt="Lady the Dog" class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-left">

And last but not least this here is my derpy dog Lady! She is very awkward for
her age and completely adorable. We rescued her as a puppy from a shelter in
Ontario called [Blue Collared Canines][6] and she's been a delightful addition
to our family ever since.

If you follow me on Twitter I promise to stop tweeting about techy stuff and
stick to [doggy pictures only][1] <i class="fa fa-hand-spock-o"></i>
