**Disconnecting and reconnecting to a network**

Assuming you're already switched to the relevant IRC network (in irssi or wevs):

``` text
/msg *status Disconnect
/msg *status Connect
```

This comes in very handy when your IRC nickname magically changes and you have
no idea wtf happened and you just want to get it back.
