Did you know that you can bypass Chrome's SSL warning page **without clicking** the Chrome prompts?

When you encounter one of these pages, type in the string `badidea` and Chrome lets you right through!

Try it out here: [https://subdomain.preloaded-hsts.badssl.com](https://subdomain.preloaded-hsts.badssl.com)

Thanks to [@jdiller](https://twitter.com/jdiller) for the tip!

**Remember that this is a bad idea so be sure you know what you are doing.**
